Hi! I'm Lydia Kondylidou, a PhD student in the Department of Theoretical
Computer Science and Theorem Proving at LMU Munich, working under the
supervision of Prof. Jasmin Blanchette.

My research interests lie in automated reasoning, with a focus on automated
theorem proving. My PhD explores how to extend SMT solvers with native support
for higher-order reasoning, as well as techniques for proof minimization in
first-order logic. More broadly, I am interested in methods for finding and
minimizing proofs in both first-order and higher-order logic.
