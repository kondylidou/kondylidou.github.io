Hi! I'm Lydia Kondylidou, a PhD student in the Department of Theoretical Computer Science and Theorem Proving at LMU Munich, working under the supervision of Prof. Jasmin Blanchette.

My research interests lie in automated reasoning, with a focus on automated theorem proving and higher-order logic. My PhD explores how to enhance SMT solvers with native support for higher-order reasoning.
