  # summary: >
  #   My research interests lie in automated reasoning, with a focus on automated
  #   theorem proving. My PhD explores how to extend SMT solvers with native
  #   support for higher-order reasoning, as well as techniques for proof
  #   minimization in first-order logic. More broadly, I am interested in methods
  #   for finding and minimizing proofs in both first-order and higher-order logic.
