**Krympa** is a research tool for minimizing equational proofs by combining
subproofs generated by automated theorem provers.  
It provides a reproducible pipeline for running provers, collecting intermediate
proofs, shortening them, and producing minimized results.

The project supports benchmarking workflows and utilities for converting proof
outputs into formats suitable for further formalization.
